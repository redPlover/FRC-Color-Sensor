# FRC-Color-Sensor
Extremely stripped down FRC subsystem for the REV Color Sensor. Prints color values and detects a blue ball versus a red one. Utilizes a Raspberry Pico along with [this code](https://github.com/ThadHouse/picocolorsensor). Currently could be used for the FRC Rapid React competition.
